RocaPinyin
==========

A simple Hànzì (Chinese characters) to Hànyǔ Pīnyīn (Chinese reading notations) conversion library, a part of the Rocaloid project.

This library does not support tones or multi-pronunciation characters, since Rocaloid does not need them. You can modify this program to suit your needs.
